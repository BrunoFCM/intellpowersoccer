"# intellpowersoccer" 
IntellPowerSoccer is a first-person video-game made at Unity Engine that approaches the powerchair football modality and uses machine leraning techniques to train intelligent agents that play against the user. It is also part of my dissertation thesis.

If you want to try the game for yourself, please use the realese updated in this project.
